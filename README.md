# Wheat Detection 
 -----
 
 - Kaggle challenge [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/overview)
 - This is a practise for me and most of the code is from this kernel [Link]( https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/training-efficientdet )
- I have refactored parts of the code to make it more uniform "ish"
